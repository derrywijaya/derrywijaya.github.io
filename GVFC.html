<strong>Gun Violence Frame Corpus</strong>

<p>Different  news  articles  about  the  same  topic often offer a variety of perspectives:  an article written about gun violence might emphasize gun control, while another might promote 2nd Amendment rights, and yet a third might focus on mental health issues. In communication research, these different perspectives are known as “frames”, which, when used in news media will influence the opinion of their readers in multiple ways. </p>

<p>This is a new dataset of news headlines and their frames related to the issue of gun violence in the United States. This Gun Violence Frame Corpus (GVFC) was curated and annotated by journalism  and  communication  experts. The articles in this dataset are drawn from a sample of news articles from a list of 30 top U.S. news websites defined in terms of traffic to the websites; and collected from four time periods over the course of 2018 in order to capture a diversity of articles. </p>

<p>We include in this dataset, headlines of news articles and their annotations. We also include the codebook protocol, which includes all of the variables for annotations and their definitions that are applied by the annotators. </p>
