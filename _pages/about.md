I am an Associate Professor and the Program Coordinator for the <a href='https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/our-programs/Master-degrees/master-of-data-science'>Data Science Program</a> at Monash University Indonesia. I also serve as the co-director of the <a href='https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/our-research/data-democracy-research-hub'>Monash Data and Democracy Research Hub</a>, an interdisciplinary lab focused on analyzing and researching the impact of data and technology on democracy in the digital age.

My current research interests lie primarily in the areas of multilingual and low-resource Natural Language Processing and in improving the performance and alignment of Language Models through self-consistency, critiques, reasoning, and in-context learning. I am also deeply engaged in analyzing framing, bias, toxicity, and misinformation within AI models and public communications.

Before joining Monash, I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Boston University. I earned my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University’s Language Technologies Institute, where I was advised by <a href='http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/'>Tom Mitchell</a>. Following that, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania under the guidance of <a href='https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/'>Chris Callison-Burch</a>. I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Computing from the National University of Singapore, where I worked with <a href='https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~steph/'>Stephane Bressan</a> as my advisor.

I serve as a program committee, area chair, senior area chair, session and  local organizer chair for various machine learning and natural language processing conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, IJCNLP, NeurIPS, ICLR, and journals.
