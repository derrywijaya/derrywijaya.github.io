I am an Associate Professor and a Program Coordinator of the <a href='https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/our-programs/Master-degrees/master-of-data-science'>Data Science Program</a> at Monash University Indonesia. I am also the co-director of the <a href='https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/our-research/data-democracy-research-hub'>Monash Data and Democracy Research Hub</a>, an interdisciplinary lab that conducts analysis and research on the role of data and technology in shaping democracy in the digital age. 

Prior to Monash, I was an Assistant Professor at Boston University's Computer Science Department. I completed my Ph.D. at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University with <a href='http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/'>Tom Mitchell</a> as my doctoral advisor. Afterwards, I was a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania working with <a href='https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/'>Chris Callison-Burch</a>. I finished my Bachelor and Master in Computing at the National University of Singapore with <a href='https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~steph/'>Stephane Bressan</a> as my advisor. 

I serve as a program committee, area chair, and reviewer for various machine learning and natural language processing conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and AAAI, and journals.
