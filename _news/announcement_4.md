I just learned about the sudden passing of my undergraduate and master’s advisor. <a href='https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~steph/'>Stéphane</a> was the professor who first introduced me to research. He took a chance on me, involving me—an undergraduate student at the time—in his work. Since then, I have followed his example by involving undergraduate students in my own research. I will always be thankful and grateful to him, his support, friendship, and kindness; and will miss him deeply.
