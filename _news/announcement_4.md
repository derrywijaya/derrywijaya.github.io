I just learned about the sudden passing of my undergraduate and master’s advisor. <a href='https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~steph/'>Stéphane</a> was the professor who first introduced me to research. He took a chance on me and involved me—an undergraduate at the time—in his research projects. Since then, I have followed his example by involving undergraduate students in my own research. I will always be grateful for his constant support, friendship, and kindness; and will miss him deeply.
